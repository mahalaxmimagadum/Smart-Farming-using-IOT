# Smart-Farming-using-IOT
# developed code in Embedded C and deployed it to run on an Arduino 

1.	Sensor Integration:
•	Integrate DHT20 sensors for temperature and humidity, moisture sensor, water sensor and luminance sensor with master(Esp32, XIAO) and slave(Esp32, XIAO) into cohesive IoT based framework.
2.	Developed Own sensor Board:
•	Designed and developed own board and circuit with the help of hardware and electronic components and developed different program for each sensors.
3.	Real time Data Collection:
•	Develop a circuit and program for that continuous and real time collection of data from all four sensors using cloud platform name as “Thingspeak” also known as IoT platform.
4.	Data Transmission:
•	Develop a system for the smooth transmission and receiver of all sensor data from master to feather to a centralized server or cloud platform using IoT protocols on Thinkspeak cloud platform.
5.	Data Analysis and Visualization:
•	Develop coding for each sensor with CRC for DHT20 sensor, soil moisture, water level detector and luminance sensor.
•	Implement the user friendly interface with feather and master (Esp32 XIAO) .
6.	Cost-effectiveness:
•	Used sensors are cheap and cost effective in the development and deployment of the Smart Framing System.
